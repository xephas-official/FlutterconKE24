# Fluttercon Kenya 2024 - Session by [Cephas Brian](https://xephas.me/community)

## Crafting Reusable Flutter App Templates for Streamlined Development (Using [mason](https://pub.dev/packages/mason))

In this talk, I will explore how reusable app templates can revolutionise how Flutter development teams work, ensuring consistency, ease of onboarding, and rapid project initiation. We'll dive into the problem of starting new projects from scratch and how it can be a tiresome and time-consuming process. To address this, we'll explore the advantages of reusable templates, such as maintaining uniform code standards, facilitating new team member onboarding, and providing a base architecture with a single command. We'll also discuss how to create and maintain these templates, including how to structure them, what to include, and how to keep them up to date. By the end of this talk, you'll have a solid understanding of how to create and use reusable app templates to streamline your Flutter development process.

## What is Mason?

Mason is a CLI tool that helps you build and manage templates for your Flutter projects. It allows you to create reusable templates for your Flutter projects, which can be used to generate boilerplate code, files, and folders with a single command. Mason templates are called Bricks, and they can be used to generate anything from a simple file to a complex project structure. Mason is a powerful tool that can help you streamline your development process, maintain consistency across your projects, and save time by automating repetitive tasks.
