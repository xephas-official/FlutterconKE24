description: In this section, we'll take a look at how to create a full app template using Mason. We'll create a brick for a simple Flutter project that will be the foundation of our app template.

# The following defines the version and build number for your brick.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.34
# followed by an optional build number (separated by a +).
version: 0.2.0+3

# The following defines the environment for the current brick.
# It includes the version of mason that the brick requires.
