# In addition, we can use the Mason VS Code Extension

This makes the process easier instead of running commands in the terminal

So in the VS Code, you can install the [Mason extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=FelixAngelov.mason), and then you can run the commands from the command palette.

1. `(Cmd + Shift + P)`, Type `mason` and also get suggestions for the commands and the bricks.
2. Select `Mason Make Local Brick` to generate the brick locally
3. Select a `folder where the brick` will be generated
4. Select the `brick` to generate
5. The brick will be generated in the selected folder
